Snake game in python originally written by EngineerMan on YouTube. 
The game was originally written in Python 2 and thus needed some bug fixes to work python3. 

The game was made slightly more robust by adding some error checking, and missing functions before ending the curses window which can mess up the terminal afterwards. 

Added a simple score counter to make the game more replayable. 

Note that this game will not run on Windows based systems as the curses module is not available on windows.
